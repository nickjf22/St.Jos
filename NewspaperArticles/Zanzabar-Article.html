		<h2>Zanzabar is bigger, better and finally perfect</h2>
		<div class="col">
		<h3>Jeffrey Lee Puckett, @JLeePuckett Published 3:32 p.m. ET April 11, 2017</h3>
		<p>
		The Zanzabar has been a nearly perfect bar from the day it opened eight years ago, with the 
		ideal blend of food, cocktails, beer and bands. It has had one enviable problem: It's been a 
		little too good.
		</p>
		<aside><q>We worked our butts off on it, and it feels good anytime someone says 'This is amazing' or 
			'I can't believe this is here.' It hasn't gotten old yet.</aside></q>
		<p>
		Shows have often been too big for the room, selling out the small space far too quickly. And 
		the atmosphere, a mix of top pub food and arcade games, has drawn crowds not interested in the 
		shows, which created a problem with ticketed customers vs. pinball customers and 
		still more crowding. Again, these are the kinds of problems venues want.
		With a recent renovation, the Zanzabar may have finally achieved perfection.
		A dedicated room for concerts has more than doubled capacity to nearly 400, and its separate 
		entrance means an end to the conflict over who has paid to see a show and who hasn't. More 
		importantly, it's a spectacular space with new handicapped-accessible bathrooms and a green 
		room for bands.
		</p>
		<p>
		The bar is celebrating throughout April, said Vectortone's Mark Evans, who books the room, and 
		last Saturday's White Reaper show was the biggest celebration so far. It was sold out and 
		yet you could still move, which has never happened, and the general mood was one of happy incredulity.
		"We're in Zanzabar," bassist Sam Wilkerson kept repeating at one point as if trying to convince 
		himself.
		Jon Wettig, who owns the Zbar with his brother, Antz, stood in back and soaked it all up.
		"We worked our butts off on it, and it feels good anytime someone says 'This is amazing' or 
		'I can't believe this is here.' It hasn't gotten old yet," he said.
		</p>
			<p>
				The new room is L-shaped with the stage at the bottom of the L, where an outdoor patio used to be. The stage is taller and
				wider and Garrett Crabtree Jr., of GlitterTitzDjz, has taken a new lighting rig to the next level with some seriously 1970s
				programming. A new sound system is in the capable hands of Joe Seidt, who first encouraged the Wettigs to expand two years
				ago.

		<p>
		The room now holds nearly as many people as doesthe main floor of Headliners Music Hall (minus 
		its balcony, in other words), but with a lowish ceiling over much of the space it retains an intimate 
		atmosphere.	"The space has adjusted to its reputation," Evans said.
		The excitement around the new Zbar has been tempered by the recent death of Sandy Wettig, 
		the Wettigs' mother and inspiration. The new concert hall is dominated by large photos of 
		Sandy and their father, Tony, who saw the new room for the first time Saturday, and the 
		brothers have often said that pleasing their parents has been their sole motivation.
		"Is there any better thing in life?" Jon said. "We were pretty crazy kids, and they probably 
		wouldn't have been surprised if we had opened a	used tire store. Jon and Antz Used Tires and 
		Bonsai Trees. That was plan B."
