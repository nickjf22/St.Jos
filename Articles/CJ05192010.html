			<p align="left">A local organization wants to purchase the 
			boarded-up J. Stoddard Johnston Elementary School from the 
			University of Louisville Foundation and convert it into apartments 
			for low-income, single parents attending college.<br>
			<br>
			Cathe Dykstra, president and chief executive of Family Scholar 
			House, said her organization expects to know by next month whether 
			it will receive tax-credit funding through the Kentucky Housing 
			Corp. to renovate the building at 2301 Bradley Ave. in the St. 
			Joseph neighborhood.<br>
			<br>
			The project, including construction, is expected to cost 
			$11.3million. That includes renovating the existing structure and 
			building an addition onto the building to allow for more housing 
			space, she said.<br>
			<br>
			Family Scholar House, which provides life-skills training and 
			housing, currently has 637 area families on a waiting list for 
			housing. Some of the parents it serves attend U of L, while others 
			are students at other area colleges, Dykstra said.<br>
			The organization envisions 57 apartments � more than double the 23 
			proposed by the university when it began looking for a developer to 
			convert it into apartments specifically for married U of L students 
			in 2008.<br>
			<br>
			A previous developer was unable to get financing for the project 
			during the recent economic crunch, university officials said.<br>
			University spokesman Mark Hebert confirmed that Family Scholar House 
			currently is holding an option to purchase the building, a contract 
			that's contingent on the organization securing financing. Hebert 
			said the organization's plan is �a use that would be in line with 
			UofL's mission.�<br>
			<br>
			The school closed in 1980, and neighbors have waited since then for 
			something permanent to be done with the building, which was built 
			about 1900 and is assessed at $220,000, according to Jefferson 
			County Property Valuation Administrator records.<br>
			<br>
			But St. Joseph's Area Association president Gail Linville said she's 
			reserving judgment on the latest plan until she sees more details on 
			how the building would be converted into apartments.<br>
			<br>
			�I can't say good, bad or otherwise about the project until it's 
			more of a done deal,� said Linville, 62, who's lived her entire life 
			in the neighborhood.<br>
			<br><aside>I can't say good, bad or otherwise about the project until it's more of a done deal,� said Linville, 62, who's lived her
			entire life in the neighborhood.</aside>
			<!-- “the aside element represents a section of content, that's complementary to the main content and could be considered separate
					from that content. An aside element can also have different meanings based on whether it's placed inside or outside an article
					element. So, for example, an aside that's nested inside an article holds content that's related to the article, but not the
					primary focus of the article. A pulled quote from the article, for instance, can be placed inside an aside because it's directly
					related to the article's content, but not essential to the overall meaning of the article. So in other words, you could remove
					the quote from the article and the content would still be understood without it.”
				
				<q> tag indicates a short in-line quotation “an aside element that's placed outside an article should describe content that's
					related to the entire page. So for example a side navigation or a list of the top articles or related posts in a page” “developers
					will use "placeholder text" when designing. This text is generally referred to as Lorem Ipsum Text and is the same as using
					Placeholder Images. You'll use this when designing to get a feel of the layout.” “HTML5 prioritizes semantic content, so
					the
					<aside> tag will help both the developer and the browser know that the
						<h3> is not part of the main content. It will also help you style the whole
							<aside> element when using CSS.” “Aside is now acceptable for secondary content when not nested within an article element.” “You
								should use main only once per page, and it shouldn't include content that might be repeated across other pages like a
								navigation bar, copyright information, a list of ads and resources, and so on.” “the header, footer, aside, and intro
								content in our page could apply to every page on the website, and aren't specific or unique to this page so they go outside
								the main element” “when no other element is suitable, you can group content with a div element. The div is a generic
								container that has almost no semantic meaning, it's just a wrapper that groups together related content.” “Designers
								and developers also use the div element as the wrapper for the entire page” which “gives you more control over the width
								of your layout to prevent your content from appearing too wide or too narrow, and it makes it easier to center your layout
								on the page with CSS” Q tag for short quotes, block tag for long, multi-line quotations “if you're writing a blog post
								where you quote an excerpt from a book, article, or another source, you should wrap that quote inside blockquote tags.”
								you can use cite=”” inside the blockquote tag to cite the source hyperlink. “The cite attribute is only valid on a few
								tags. You can't add a cite attribute to every tag, only to blockquote, del, ins, and q tags. But none of these would
								be a replacement for anchor tags, because they have a different functional purpose”

			The school was named for J. Stoddard Johnston, who served as 
			Kentucky's secretary of state from 1875 to 1879, was later an 
			associate editor of The Courier-Journal and is buried in Cave Hill 
			Cemetery.<br>
			<br>
			After the school closed, it served for a short time as a day-care 
			center for the children of U of L staff members and students. 
			Linville said the building, which has been boarded up for about two 
			decades, has a strong sentimental value to her.<br>
			�I've had at least 63 of my family members go through that school,� 
			she said.<br>
			Linville believes student housing is a viable use for the property, 
			but she would like to see the building remain without being added 
			onto.<br>
			<br>
			Family Scholar House officials met with Linville and other 
			neighborhood leaders in April to let them know about their initial 
			plan, and Dykstra anticipates meeting with them again within 45 days 
			after they secure financing.<br>
			<br>
			Founded as Project Women in 1995, the Scholar House program has 
			helped find housing and provided life-skills training for hundreds 
			of single parents and their children. Most parents are single 
			mothers.<br>
			<br>
			In 2008, Louisville Scholar House began taking in families at a 
			56-unit development near U of L's Belknap Campus at Fifth and Lee 
			streets. Last March, the organization also announced a $10million 
			plan to build 54 apartments at First and Breckinridge streets called 
			Downtown Scholar House. Construction on that project is under way 
			and the first residents are expected to move there in January, 
			Dykstra said.<br>
			<br>
			The apartment complexes include subsidized housing, with rent 
			covered by federal housing vouchers. Tax credits are often sold to 
			investors for cash to build low-income housing.<br>
