			<br>
			Next month, the Grotto and Garden of Our Lady of Lourdes, off 
			President's Boulevard next to University Park Apartments, will 
			receive a 3-foot-tall statue of Bernadette Soubirous. In 1858, the 
			14-year-old French girl claimed to have seen a vision of the Virgin 
			Mary on 18 occasions in a cave-like grotto in Lourdes, France. <br>
			<br>
			The site of the visions was the inspiration for building the 
			Louisville grotto in 1927 on the grounds of St. Joseph Infirmary. 
			(The Catholic hospital was razed in the 1980s and replaced by 
			Audubon Hospital on Poplar Level Road.) <br>
			<br>
			St. Joseph Neighborhood Association President Gail Linville is 
			coordinating Bernadette's installation after months of searching 
			online and across the eastern United States. <br>
			<br>
			Linville said she ended up buying the figure for $75 from a Pleasure 
			Ridge Park-area pet store that also sold stone statues. <br>
			<br>
			&quot;I've looked everywhere and ended up finding her 10 miles from my 
			home,&quot; chuckled the lifelong St. Joseph resident. <br>

				“an aside element that's placed outside an article should describe content that's related to the entire page. So for example a side navigation or a list of the top articles or related posts in a page”
				“developers will use "placeholder text" when designing. This text is generally referred to as Lorem Ipsum Text and is the same as using Placeholder Images.
				You'll use this when designing to get a feel of the layout.”
				“HTML5 prioritizes semantic content, so the <aside> tag will help both the developer and the browser know that the <h3> is not part of the main content. It will also help you style the whole <aside> element when using CSS.”
				“Aside is now acceptable for secondary content when not nested within an article element.”
				“You should use main only once per page, and it shouldn't include content that might be repeated across other pages like a navigation bar, copyright information, a list of ads and resources, and so on.”
				“the header, footer, aside, and intro content in our page could apply to every page on the website, and aren't specific or unique to this page so they go outside the main element”
				“when no other element is suitable, you can group content with a div element. The div is a generic container that has almost no semantic meaning, it's just a wrapper that groups together related content.” “Designers and developers also use the div element as the wrapper for the entire page” which “gives you more control over the width of your layout to prevent your content from appearing too wide or too narrow, and it makes it easier to center your layout on the page with CSS”
				
				Q tag for short quotes, block tag for long, multi-line quotations
				“if you're writing a blog post where you quote an excerpt from a book, article, or another source, you should wrap that quote inside blockquote tags.” you can use cite=”” inside the blockquote tag to cite the source hyperlink.
				“The cite attribute is only valid on a few tags. You can't add a cite attribute to every tag, only to blockquote, del, ins, and q tags. But none of these would be a replacement for anchor tags, because they have a different functional purpose”

			A 5-foot-tall statue of Mary installed in the grotto last year was 
			paid for with a $1,200 donation (plus $200 shipping). <br>
			<br>
			The association asked artist Dwane Beckhart to paint the stone 
			figure of Bernadette, who is portrayed kneeling with a candle. <br>
			<br>
			The pose commemorates what Catholics call the Miracle of the Candle, 
			which refers to the girl's 16th visit from Mary. During that visit, 
			Bernadette was said to cover the flame of a candle with a hand for 
			at least 15 minutes without injury. <br>
			<br>
			As a grotto volunteer, Beckhart also painted the Virgin Mary statue 
			and the 14 stations of the cross in 2003 and a fence mural at 
			Attwood Street and Bradley Avenue. <br>
			<br>
			Beckhart is a maintenance employee and longtime member of Southeast 
			Christian Church, where he has painted murals in the children's 
			library and activity center. <br>
			<br>
			Beckhart said his reason for doing the work is simple: He loves the 
			way it makes him feel. &quot;I just really like doing things for church 
			and the community,&quot; he said. <br>
			<br>
			The grotto's architects were D.X. Murphy and Bros., Catholics who 
			designed numerous Catholic schools, churches and rectories in the 
			Louisville area. <br>
			<br>
			The &quot;Grotto Grannies,&quot; a group of elderly neighborhood volunteers, 
			adopted the grotto about 20 years ago. They have planted garden 
			plots and helped secure and oversee the installation of a historical 
			marker, a floodlight, flagpole, sundial and memorial urn honoring 
			former association President Ernie Blankenship, who died in 2002.
			<br>
			<br>
			The Kentucky Historical Society received a complaint in 2005 about 
			the historic marker. The grotto property belongs to the University 
			of Louisville, and thus the marker's narrative of the religious 
			event violated the principle of separation of church and state, the 
			complaint said. <br>
			<br>
			The state attorney general said the narrative could remain because 
			it makes no attempt to advocate a particular religious perspective.
			<br>
			<br>
			Linville said no other major improvements are planned. During the 
			years-long restoration project, she added, vandalism has dropped 
			while the number of visitors has risen. <br>
			<br>
			&quot;Because volunteers are over there at different hours, we notice 
			people in there at different times when once there weren't any,&quot; she 
			said. &quot;At last year's installation, I think we had about 100 
			people.&quot; <br>
			<br>
			Despite initial skepticism, Bernadette's claims eventually were 
			accepted by the Roman Catholic Church and in 1933 she was canonized.
