		<p align="left">The St. Joseph Area Association realized a longtime 
		dream last year when it dedicated a state highway historical marker for 
		the St. Joseph grotto � formally called The Grotto and Garden of Our 
		Lady of Lourdes. <br>
		<br>
		But the Kentucky Historical Society has received a complaint about the 
		marker's wording because it refers to a purported appearance of the 
		Virgin Mary in France almost 150 years ago. The complaint said the 
		wording violates constitutional provisions for separation of church and 
		state. <br>
		<br>
		State Rep. Jim Wayne, D-Louisville, who represents the St. Joseph area, 
		yesterday asked Attorney General Greg Stumbo's office for an opinion on 
		the constitutionality of the wording. <br>
		<br>
		The historical society, which is part of the Commerce Cabinet and 
		oversees the marker program, told the St. Joseph neighborhood 
		association last fall that the marker might need to be reworded. <br>
		<br>
		But the association objected to a wording change, saying the story of 
		Mary appearing to a girl named Bernadette is intrinsic to the site's 
		significance. &quot;That's the way the story's been all these years, whether 
		it's fact or fiction,&quot; said Gail Linville, the association's president.
		<br>
		<br>
		The grotto -- built in 1927 -- is on the former grounds of the old St. 
		Joseph Infirmary, a Catholic hospital that was razed in 1980. The 
		University of Louisville owns the grotto property. Volunteers and 
		neighbors had spent several years restoring and maintaining the grotto, 
		and they raised about $1,700 to have the marker made and installed. <br>
		<br>
<aside>"The grotto -- built in 1927 -- is on the former grounds of the old St. Joseph Infirmary, a Catholic hospital that was razed
in 1980."</aside>
		The marker says the local grotto is modeled on the natural grotto at 
		Lourdes, in southwest France, &quot;where Virgin Mary appeared to Bernadette 
		Soubirous in 1858.&quot; It goes on to say that their statues once adorned 
		the Louisville grotto. The full text of the marker is shown in photos at 
		www.stjosaa.org. <br>
		<br>
		The historical society began reviewing the marker's wording last fall 
		after it received a complaint about it from someone -- the state 
		couldn't provide his or her name yesterday. Historical society 
		spokeswoman Alice Rogers said yesterday that she didn't know the 
		person's name and didn't know if she could release it. <br>
		<br>
		Nelson Dawson, director of research and interpretation with the 
		historical society, has proposed one possible rewording that would call 
		the Lourdes grotto simply &quot;a world famous Marian shrine.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Wayne, a Roman Catholic, said he can understand why the wording issue 
		was raised, because the reference to Mary's appearance &quot;is not a fact&quot; 
		but rather a matter of &quot;faith for some Catholics. It's not a doctrine of 
		the Church.&quot; The state cannot be involved in proselytizing or promoting 
		one religion over another, he said. <br>
		<br>
		Wayne asked for the attorney general's opinion at the request of the 
		neighborhood association. The request will be reviewed, said Vicki 
		Glass, a spokeswoman for the attorney general. <br>
		<br>
		Rogers said the historical society most likely will wait to hear the 
		opinion before taking any further action. <br>
		<br>
		Mike Zanone, the St. Joseph association's vice president, said some 
		association members were irate when they heard that the society said the 
		wording might need to be changed. <br>
		<br>
		&quot;It seems like it's taking it to an extreme,&quot; he said. &quot;What part do we 
		or don't we include? How much do we edit that story to fit values 
		today?&quot; <br>
