			<p align="left">A Grotto and Garden of Our Lady of Lourdes will 
			receive image of girl who said she saw the Virgin Mary at Lourdes, 
			France<br>
			On May 6, the Sunday after Derby Day, the Grotto Grannies and 
			Grandpas, along with members of Our Mother of Sorrows Church and the 
			St. Joseph Neighborhood Association, will hold a procession to the 
			Grotto and Garden of Our Lady of Lourdes, which rests on the grounds 
			that once held the old St. Joseph Infirmary. <br>
			<br>
			Once they reach the grotto, its newest statue � of Bernadette, the 
			14-year-old girl who claimed to have seen the Virgin Mary on 18 
			different occasions in Lourdes, France � will be blessed by Father 
			William Martin, pastor at Our Mother of Sorrows. <br>
			<br>
			The statue of Bernadette was found a few weeks ago at a Dixie 
			Highway concrete figures retail outlet. Gayle Linville, president of 
			the neighborhood association, had been looking for a likeness of 
			Bernadette for quite a while. <br>
			<br>
			�I�d stop anytime I was out driving and saw a place that sold 
			statues and figures,� she explained recently. �One day I was driving 
			to a friend�s house out on Dixie, and I saw concrete statues at the 
			corner of Dixie and Greenwood Road and sure enough, there she was.�
			<br><aside>"The concrete likeness of Bernadette �looked like she�d been there quite a while,� Linville said."</aside>
			<br>
			The concrete likeness of Bernadette �looked like she�d been there 
			quite a while,� Linville said. But with the help of Joseph Schnurr 
			and his workers � the same people who placed the five-foot statue of 
			the Virgin Mary in the grotto last year � Bernadette was 
			pressure-washed. <br>
			<br>
			Then artist Dwane Beckhart, who restored and re-painted the grotto�s 
			Stations of the Cross, painted the statue of Bernadette, who is 
			shown kneeling and holding a candle, the 17th apparition in the 
			series, according to Grotto Granny Ruth Gerlach. <br>
			<br>
			�I looked in the Our Lady of Lourdes prayer book,� she explained, 
			�and it said the apparition with the candle was the 17th.� <br>
			<br>
			It was during that 17th visit from the Virgin Mary that Bernadette 
			is said to have held her hand over a burning candle for 15 minutes 
			without receiving any burns. <br>
			<br>
			Finding the statue was a God-send, Linville said. And finding some 
			help for the Grotto Grannies and Grandpas would be a God-send, too, 
			said Gerlach. <br>
			<br>
			�We are all getting pretty well on in age,� she noted, �and we�re 
			all pitching in and helping keep the grotto up as much as we can. 
			But we can�t do as much work as we once did and we could use some 
			help.� <br>
			<br>
			What Ruth Gerlach and the other Grotto Grannies and Grandpas are 
			hoping for are some younger couples willing to assume the legacy of 
			the work the original group began in late 1999. That�s when about 20 
			grannies and grandpas began restoring the Grotto of Our Lady of 
			Lourdes, which had lain dormant and deteriorating for more than 20 
			years. <br>
			<br>
			The grotto was built in 1927 as a place where patients, medical 
			staff and sisters who served at St. Joseph Infirmary could find 
			comfort and solace. The volunteers who�ve worked the past eight 
			years have once again made the grotto what it was meant to be � a 
			beautiful, quiet place for prayer and reflection. <br>
			<br>
			�But we just can�t keep taking care of it forever,� Gerlach noted. 
			�I�m old � I�m 79 � but I�m not as old as some of the others. Helen 
			Spalding will be 90, and she was there the other day working in the 
			rain with everybody else. We have others in their eighties. ... 
			We�re just getting older, and we can�t do as much as we once did.�
			<br>
			<br>
			New volunteers �don�t have to be terribly young,� she said. 
			�Middle-aged couples would be fine. We have a wonderful couple, 
			Barbara and Kenny Bruce, who are a bit younger than we are and 
			they�ve been so much help. We just need a few more couples like 
			them.� <br>
			<br>
			Those interested in helping the Grotto Grannies and Grandpas can 
			call Gail Linville, the St. Joseph Neighborhood Association 
			president, at 637-3159, or Ruth Gerlach at 637-6108</td>
