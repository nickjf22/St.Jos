			<p align="left">An effort begun four years ago by St. Joseph to get new curbs along 
			Eastern Parkway has finally paid off. <br>
			<br>
			New curbs have been installed near Preston and Shelby streets. <br>
			<br>
			&quot;We had to talk to all sorts of agencies to get it done,&quot; said Gail 
			Linville, president of the St. Joseph Area Association. &quot;It took 
			awhile to get going.&quot; <br>
			<br>
			Residents said the old curbs were crumbling and too shallow for good 
			drainage. <br>
			<br>
			Helping with the project was Metro Council President Jim King, whose 
			District 10 includes the area. Neighbors got his attention by asking 
			one simple question: &quot;Eastern Parkway and Bardstown Road look nice. 
			Why not Eastern Parkway and Preston?&quot; said Ruth Gerlach, a longtime 
			association activist. <br>
			<br>
			&quot;That got his attention real quick,&quot; Linville said. King agreed. <br>
			<br>
			Linville, Gerlach and Mike Zanone, the St. Joseph association's vice 
			president, led the residents' effort, and King coordinated the 
			agencies: Louisville Metro Works and Parks departments, the Transit 
			Authority of River City, the Olmsted Conservancy and the 
			Metropolitan Sewer District. <br>
			<br>
			New box curbs have replaced crumbling shallow curbs along Eastern 
			Parkway from about 100 feet west of Preston to the entrances to the 
			Walgreens drugstore and Shoney's restaurant east of Shelby Sidewalks 
			also were improved. <br>
			<br>
			The project cost $160,000, including landscaping, bus shelters and 
			benches that will be installed. King and TARC provided $65,000 each, 
			and MSD $30,000. <br>

			<br>
			King said the new curbs could set a standard for improvements along 
			all of Eastern Parkway. <br>
			<br>
			With the old curbs, rain water often pooled along Eastern Parkway, 
			especially in front of the White Castle and Radio Shack, Linville 
			said. Now water drains quickly. &quot;The new curbs look a lot better 
			too,&quot; she said. <br>
			<br>
			King said the improved sidewalks will be especially helpful to 
			residents of Lourdes Hall, a retirement home on Eastern Parkway near 
			Preston. <br>
			<br>
			The project wasn't part of beautification efforts along Preston 
			between the Watterson Expressway and Eastern Parkway. But the two 
			projects eventually could join. Preston corridor improvements 
			between Hess Lane and Eastern Parkway could begin in a year and 
			further help the appearance of the Eastern Parkway-Preston Street 
			corner. <br>
			<br>
			That sounds good to Gerlach, a neighborhood resident for 80 years 
			who worked as a teenager in a Walgreens that used to be on the 
			corner. <br>
			<br>
			&quot;This corner and this part of town have been neglected,&quot; she said. 
			&quot;This corner used to be very nice. I hope it can be nice again.&quot; <br>
