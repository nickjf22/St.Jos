						<p>The Kentucky Historical Society received a complaint

						that it violated the principle of separation of church

						&quot;Plainly, this marker does not convey a message of 
						governmental endorsement of religion,&quot; says the letter, 
						written for Attorney General Greg Stumbo by Robert S. 
						Jones, executive director of Stumbo's office of civil 
						and environmental law. 
						<p>The letter was sent to state Rep. Jim Wayne, 
						D-Louisville, after he inquired about the 
						constitutionality of the marker's wording at the request 
						of the neighborhood association. </p>
						<p>Alice Rogers, a spokeswoman for the Kentucky 
						Historical Society, which oversees the marker program, 
						said yesterday that she had not seen Jones' letter and 
						needed to consult the society's staff before commenting 
						on how it might affect any possible rewording. </p>
						<p>&quot;I think it affirms what we said all along,&quot; said 
						Mike Zanone, vice president of the neighborhood 
						association. &quot;There was a lot of thought that went into 
						the wording of the marker.&quot; </p>
						<p>Gail Linville, the group's president, said she has 
						received messages and calls supporting the association's 
						position. </p>
						<p>The marker was put up on Bradley Avenue last year to 
						honor the nearby Grotto and Garden of Our Lady of 
						Lourdes, which was built in 1927 on the grounds of the 
						old St. Joseph Infirmary, a Catholic hospital that was 
						razed in 1980. </p>
						<p>The marker says the local grotto is modeled on the 
						natural grotto at Lourdes, in southwest France, &quot;where 
						Virgin Mary appeared to Bernadette Soubirous in 1858.&quot;
						</p>
						<p>Jones' letter says an earlier official opinion from 
						the attorney general's office concerning state support 
						for preservation of the grotto is also applicable to the 
						marker issue. </p>
						<p>That opinion said the University of Louisville, which 
						owns the grotto property, may authorize the restoration 
						of the grotto, a &quot;registered state and local historical 
						landmark,&quot; by the neighborhood association &quot;because of 
						its cultural and historical value to the Louisville 
						community.&quot; </p>
						<p>The opinion, as described in the letter, says that 
						&quot;so long as the language on the marker does not advocate 
						a religious perspective and instead limits the language 
						to historical issues, it meets applicable First 
						Amendment scrutiny.&quot; </p>
