			<p align="left">During the past two years, James Weiter has gotten 
			used to people stopping by the fence around his property in St. 
			Joseph. People stop, look, point and talk. <br>
			<br>
			&quot;Three or four times a week I see people do that,&quot; Weiter said. 
			&quot;It's mostly middle-aged people. A lot of times they bring their 
			parents.&quot; <br>
			<br>
			The wooden fence, along Atwood Street and Bradley Avenue, gets 
			attention because it contains a colorful mural depicting about 25 
			buildings with roots in St. Joseph. <br>
			<br>
			The fence is a neighborhood history lesson that's 6 feet tall and 
			about 170 feet long. <br>
			<br>
			Some of the buildings have been razed and others still stand. &quot;They 
			can all take you back,&quot; said Gail Linville, president of the St. 
			Joseph Area Association. <br>
			<br>
			Linville and other association members asked Weiter in 2006 if a 
			mural could be painted on the fence around his business, Luv-It 
			Landscaping. &quot;A lot of people don't know anything about the history 
			of St. Joseph,&quot; Linville said. <br>
			<br>
			Weiter agreed. He even installed three benches and a flagpole and 
			planted shrubs, flowers and a birch tree along the Bradley Avenue 
			portion of the fence. <br>
			<br>
			&quot;I was glad to do it,&quot; said Weiter, who lives on Atwood, next to his 
			business. &quot;People need to do things like this for the good of the 
			neighborhood.&quot; <br>
			<br><aside>&quot;I was glad to do it,&quot; said Weiter, who lives on Atwood, next to his business. &quot;People need to do things like
			this for the good of the neighborhood.&quot;
			<br></aside>
			
			The part of the mural that seems to draw the most attention, Weiter 
			said, shows the old St. Joseph Infirmary. It gave the neighborhood 
			its name and was its largest and best-known institution. <br>
			<br>
			Operated by the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, the hospital opened 
			in 1926 on Eastern Parkway west of Preston Street. It closed in 
			1980, when many of its services were transferred to what now is 
			Norton Audubon Hospital. <br>
			<br>
			Other buildings in the mural are less grand. They include churches, 
			bars, groceries, drugstores, barber shops, a gas station, beer 
			depot, bakery and the old Capitol movie theater. <br>
			<br>
			Some of the businesses in the mural closed and have been replaced. 
			For example, the mural includes the old A&amp;P grocery on Miller 
			Avenue, now a Pic-Pac. <br>
			<br>
			&quot;I remember going to that A&amp;P,&quot; said Linville, who grew up in St. 
			Joseph. &quot;My dad was a policeman. He got paid on the first and the 
			15th. That's when we went to the grocery.&quot; <br>
			<br>
			Similarly, the mural shows Gutgsell's Tavern (now Uncle Pleasant's), 
			Hafendorfer's Drug Store (now the Christian Book Nook) and Molly's 
			Beer Depot (now Mr. Gatti's). <br>
			<br>
			An Oertel's 92 sign, advertising the long-gone local beer, stood 
			next to Molly's, according to the mural. <br>
			<br>
			One of the more dramatic changes involved Jack's Barber Shop. It's 
			now the Tabernacle of David. The mural also includes the Zanzibar, 
			also called the Z-Bar. The Brown Bag Deli &amp; Pub is there now. <br>
			<br>
			Other sites depicted in the mural are still operating after a 
			generation or longer. They include the Full Gospel Mission, Atwood 
			Wesleyan Church, Swiss Hall, Bill's Barbershop, the White Castle, 
			Our Mother of Sorrows Catholic Church and the Cottage Inn. <br>
			<br>
			Dwane Beckhart, who created the mural and paid for the paint, noted 
			that it includes two 1950s automobiles from opposite ends of the 
			spectrum. One was a gold 1959 Cadillac with big fins. The other is a 
			Nash Rambler, the economy car of its time. <br>
			<br>
			&quot;I drew them in because they were from the same time period&quot; as much 
			of the rest of the mural, Beckhart said. He lives in St. Regis Park 
			in eastern Jefferson County, but his parents grew up in St. Joseph.
			<br>
			<br>
			Beckhart, who did the work as a volunteer, said it took him about 
			two weeks to paint the mural. He might paint some more, if Linville 
			gets her way. <br>
			<br>
			&quot;There's room for more on the mural,&quot; she said. <br>
			<br>
			Linville hopes it can include a diner called the Nickel House that 
			was next to Gutgsell's on Preston Street. &quot;If I remember right, they 
			served something called a moon burger.&quot; <br>
