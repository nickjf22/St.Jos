			<p align="left">Just shy of its first anniversary, The Kentucky 
			Humane Society's Operation Spay and Neuter Incentive Program is 
			celebrating its first major milestone -- completion of its 6,000th 
			surgery. <br>
			<br>
			Operation SNIP, at 2445 Crittenden Drive in the St. Joseph area, 
			provides low-cost surgeries and vaccinations for pets of needy 
			people and coordinates pet transportation to and from the clinic for 
			such owners in nearby counties. <br>
			<br><aside>Operation SNIP, at 2445 Crittenden Drive in the St. Joseph area, provides low-cost surgeries and vaccinations for pets of
			needy people and coordinates pet transportation to and from the clinic for such owners in nearby counties.</aside>
		
			The Jefferson counties involved are Scott, Trimble, Henry, Spencer, 
			Grayson, Bullitt and Carroll counties. In Indiana, the clinic serves 
			Dearborn and Floyd counties. <br>
			<br>
			The clinic also is developing a pickup and delivery service for 
			eligible pet owners in seven ZIP codes in the county -- 40202, 
			40203, 40208, 40210, 40211, 40212 and 40215 -- where 2000 Census 
			statistics showed a significant number of people and families living 
			at or below poverty level. <br>
			<br>
			It also coordinates transportation of pets with various 
			animal-rescue groups within a 90-mile radius. <br>
			<br>
			Spaying or neutering costs $35 to $55; some financial assistance is 
			available. Applicants' need is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
			<br>
			<br>
			The Crittenden Drive effort is an outgrowth of a weekly clinic that 
			the society offered at its Eastpoint location, at 13310 Magisterial 
			Drive. That effort completed 1,100 surgeries. The Crittenden Drive 
			site is considered more central. <br>
			<br>
			Humane Society officials hope their efforts will decrease the number 
			of animal euthanizations in Jefferson County. They also believe the 
			procedures will lead to longer and healthier lives for the animals, 
			with fewer risks for contracting certain diseases and cancer. <br>
			<br>
			The society also altered more than 5,400 adoptable pets last year.
			<br>
			<br>
			&quot;We want to put an end to euthanizing adoptable pets in our area, so 
			they each can find a permanent home,&quot; said Lori Kane Redmon, the 
			society's president. &quot;A high-volume spay/neuter program is the only 
			way to accomplish that and prevent animals from suffering in the 
			future.&quot; <br>
			<br>
			Officials said word of mouth and billboard and radio advertisements 
			helped the operation attract clients. <br>
